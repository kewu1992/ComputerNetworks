1. Assume a UDP packet received from the Internet is always complete (invoke recvfrom() onece will get a complete UDP packet), which is not true. It is possible that a UDP packet only send a half in the first send (e.g. because signal interrupt). A robuster way is use a buffer to store recieved data. First examine header (the first 16 bytes), get the length of packet. Then process data in the buffer. Just like we have done in the first project. 

2. The program will save all packets in memory until a complete chunk is downloaded. Then the program will write the chunk to file. It may be memory-consuming.
